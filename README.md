The project includes various examples that demonstrate how to effectively use ESP32 functions. To test the examples, the firmware is programmed onto the ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU).

## Example Layout

- `button`  Demonstrates how to use the configurable buttons in SenseCAP Indicator.
- `console` Demonstrates how to use of command line functions.
- `esp32_rp2040_comm` Demonstration showcases the communication between ESP32 and RP2040.
- `indicator_basis`  This is a comprehensive demo,mainly implements time, sensor data display, and some configuration functions.
- `indicator_openai` This is a comprehensive demo,mainly based on the indicator_basis demo with added chartGPT and DALLâ€¢E functions.
- `indicator_lora`  Demonstrates how to communicate using lora in SenseCAP Indicator.
- `lvgl_demos` Demonstrated some demos of lvgl.
- `photo_demo` Demonstrates how to display a photo of yourself.
- `squareline_demo` Demonstrates how to display the UI file exported by the squareline project.

## **SenseCAP Indicator Abstract**

SenseCAP Indicator is a 4-inch touch screen driven by ESP32-S3 and RP2040 Dual-MCU and supports Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/LoRa communication.

The device comes two Grove interfaces, which supports ADC and I2C transmission protocols, and two USB Type-C ports with GPIO expantion pins inside, so user can easily expand external accessories via USB port.

SenseCAP Indicator is a fully open source powerful IoT development platform for developers. One-stop ODM Fusion service is also available for customization and quick scale-up.
