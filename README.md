# **SenseCAP Indicator ESP32**

<!-- This project is developed based on ESP32-IDF, and Using C/C++ language development. There are some examples to teach you how to use some functions of ESP32. The firmware of the example is burned into the ESP32 MCU. -->

This project is built on the ESP32 IoT Development Framework (IDF) and utilizes the C/C++ programming language for development.

The project includes various examples that demonstrate how to effectively use ESP32 functions. To test the examples, the firmware is programmed onto the ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU).

## Example Layout

- `button`  Demonstrates how to use the configurable buttons in SenseCAP Indicator.
- `console` Demonstrates how to use of command line functions.
- `esp32_rp2040_comm` Demonstration showcases the communication between ESP32 and RP2040.
- `indicator_basis`  This is a comprehensive demo,mainly implements time, sensor data display, and some configuration functions.
- `indicator_openai` This is a comprehensive demo,mainly based on the indicator_basis demo with added chartGPT and DALLâ€¢E functions.
- `indicator_lora`  Demonstrates how to communicate using lora in SenseCAP Indicator.
- `lvgl_demos` Demonstrated some demos of lvgl.
- `photo_demo` Demonstrates how to display a photo of yourself.
- `squareline_demo` Demonstrates how to display the UI file exported by the squareline project.
- `lorawan_demo` Demonstrates how to communicate using lorawan in SenseCAP Indicator.

## Usage

> [!Warning]  
> Please use ESP-IDF version `v5.1.x`. Do not use any lower or higher versions.

1. Get and install the [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step) development framework.
2. Download this project and open it in the ESP-IDF development framework.
3. run `idf.py build flash` to compile and burn the firmware.
