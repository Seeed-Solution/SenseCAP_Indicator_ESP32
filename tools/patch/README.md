# IDF Patch

The [patch](./patch/release5.0_psram_octal_120m.patch) is intended to achieve the best performance of RGB LCD by using the **PSRAM Octal 120 MHz** feature. The patch is only used for the **release/v5.0** branch of ESP-IDF. For the **master** branch, the PSRAM Octal 120 MHz feature can be directly used by enabling the `IDF_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` option.

**Note: The PSRAM Octal 120 MHz feature has temperature risks and cannot guarantee normal functioning with a temperature higher than 65 degrees Celsius.**

Please make sure your IDF project is clean (use `git status` to check), then the patch can be applied by following commands:

```
cd <root directory of IDF>
git apply --whitespace=fix <path of the patch>/release5.0_psram_octal_120m.patch # Nothing return if success
git status      # Check whether the operation is successful, the output should look like below:
